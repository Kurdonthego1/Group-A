## Project Background
The problem we plan to tackle is creating a website that maps the SDG to local priorities in Regina. Currently, Regina doesn't have a community indicator system so by doing this, we can also cover another challenge/task that comes with making this website: influencing action and bringing awareness to the community of Regina. Additionally, designing the website in such a way as to inspire action and reach decision-makers will be one of many top priorities. Although we want it to reach important people, we also want to make the site easy enough to read and understand for the general public who look to educate themselves about Regina for their own needs/goals.
